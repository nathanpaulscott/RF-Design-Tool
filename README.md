# RF-Design-Tool
This is a custom Mapinfo/Mapbasic based RF Design, Deployment, Optimisation Tool.  I wrote it around 2007 after using a very basic pre-cursor to it on a project in Australia with Aircom.  That precursor tool was basic and I hated the way it worked but the fundamental idea was good, so I said to myself, I can see the value of the tool and I can make it way way better, so I did.  I added features to it over the years, I used it extensively on every project I was on since then, it was and still is one of the most useful tools I have ever created.

It allows you to import a cellular network and it draws it in mapinfo, or in google earth, allows you to import, view, edit neighbours, drive test data, kpi statistics.  It allows you to to do quick planning and many other things.

While the coding is definitely not perfect, at least it is quite modular, which helps in maintainability.

I would appreciate if you do not use this without my permission, but Im not going to stop you.  If you do use it, don't be an asshole and just rename it and call it your own, I have seen people do that with presentations I have written.  Feel free to copy parts fromm it and make your own tool, better, would be that you help me to improve it here.
