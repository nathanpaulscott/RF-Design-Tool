# RF-Design-Tool
This is a custom Mapinfo/Mapbasic based RF Design, Deployment, Optimisation Tool.  I wrote it around 2007 and added features to it over the years, I used it extensively on every project I was on since then, it was and still is one of the most useful tools I have ever created.

It allows you to import a cellular network and it draws it in mapinfo, or in google earth, allows you to import, view, edit neighbours, drive test data, kpi statistics.  It allows you to to do quick planning and many other things.

While the coding is definitely not perfect, at least it is quite modular, which helps in maintainability.

I would appreciate if you do not use this without my permission, but I can't stop you.
